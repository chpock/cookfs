* Store initial -smallfilesize / -smallfilebuffer / -pagesize values that were
  specified when first mounted, and use them by default when reopening
  an archive for writing. If these parameters were defined when reopening
  an archive for writing, then store these new values. This will allow to
  use the same parameters each time when an archive is opened for writing.

* add a feature to link with zlib directly, but not using zlib functions
  from Tcl. This will allow to use zlib more efficiently as zlib functions
  are more suitable to work with plain byte buffers without Tcl objects.
  This will be useful when cookfs is statically linked, but not built as
  a loadable package.

* add a feature to link with crypto-functions from mbedTLS. This will allow
  to save some bytes when application uses both cookfs&mbedtls.

* Investigate an issue with -directory parameter for glob.
  See tests cookfsVfs-1.8.4.1.1 and cookfsVfs-1.8.4.1.2.
  Then some variable (object) is passed to -directory argument
  of the command glob, then internal cookfs representation is
  linked to this object. But this representation is not freed
  even if variable (object) is removed. It is released only at
  the end of the evaluation of the Tcl source file. It is need
  to be investogated why internal representation is not released
  when corresponding object is deleted.

* Add documentation as HTML to github pages

* Add ability to disable custom compression to reduce size footprint when it is not needed

* Add ability to disable async compression to reduce size footprint when it is not needed

* Update bzip2 and use it as a submodule. Perhaps this will get rid of its compile-time warnings.

* Add ability/subcommand to copy files from/to cookfs more efficiently than using 'file copy'.
  It can be something like 'cookfs copy <from disk> <cookfs endpoint>"

* Add ability to get a list of pages with their properties (compression, compression level,
  encryption, compressed size, uncompressed size)

* Add ability to get information about pagesindex and fsindex (compression, compression level,
  encryption, compressed size, uncompressed size). This will be useful for analyzing the contents
  of a cookfs archive.

* Add ability to get information about whole archive (file size, head size, cookfs size).
  It should be available from attributes to a mount point.

* Add support for storing file permissions and attributes (for Windows platform)

* Add support for 'file attribute' commands to return general attributes and attributes like zipfs in Tcl9
* Add support for 'zipfs mkimg'-like command

* Allow to get/set parameters and manage cookfs via global command ::cookfs
cookfs password $mount_point "password"
cookfs compression $mount_point "zlib"
cookfs copy /foo/bar $mount_point
cookfs gethead (and gettail?) - to get file part before cookfs

== Examples

* Add simple example of tclsh with cookfs. Compare with tclsh9+zipfs (size and
loading speed). This example will cover cookfs usage from C side.

* Add an example of a Tcl archiver application that uses the cookfs format.
It will be like any other archiver and will support file
compression/decompression. This example will cover cookfs usage from Tcl side.
