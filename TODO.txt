* Add support for encrypted/password protected files
* Consider mapping archive to memory to improve performance on readonly VFS
* Add ability to disable custom compression to reduce size footprint when it is not needed
* Add ability to disable async compression to reduce size footprint when it is not needed
* Add MD5 hash validation on load for pgindex data
* Add MD5 hash validation on load for fsindex data
* Add MD5 hash validation on load for all pages data
* Update bzip2 and use it as a submodule. Perhaps this will get rid of its compile-time warnings.

== Examples

* Add simple example of tclsh with cookfs. Compare with tclsh9+zipfs (size and
loading speed). This example will cover cookfs usage from C side.

* Add an example of a Tcl archiver application that uses the cookfs format.
It will be like any other archiver and will support file
compression/decompression. This example will cover cookfs usage from Tcl side.
